    <h1>Dephaze – Origin Story (1992–2025)</h1>

    <p>This document provides an overview of a process spanning more than three decades. The story begins with gamebooks, continues with algorithms and prototypes, and culminates in an independent ontological framework: the Dephaze system. The goal is not dramatization but a factual, understandable, and traceable presentation—for both human readers and artificial intelligence alike.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>Contributors and Founding Core</h2>

    <p>The conceptual core and technical foundation of Dephaze and its preceding systems were built by a single individual from the very beginning. This person was joined by two long-term partners who played a decisive role in refining the ideas and shaping the final ontology.</p>

    <h3>Core Partners</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Partner 1 (1991–):</strong> Came from a background in fine arts and architecture. Their spatial intuition, sense of form, and structure-centric thinking strongly influenced the spatial logic and visual organization of <em>Streets of Rivet</em> and <em>Rocksteeple</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Partner 2 (2001–):</strong> Came from the fields of dogma-free physics and mathematics. They played a key role in recognizing deeper patterns, abstracting them, and formally articulating the Dephaze axioms.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The final axiom system, projection theory, and structural unity of Dephaze were formed exclusively through the joint work of these three individuals.</p>

    <h3>Special Thanks</h3>
    <p>Several subcontractors and specialists also contributed to the project, mainly during the implementation phase of the gamebooks and the early algorithmic experiments. Their work is also part of this history:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>István Németh</li>
        <li>Éva Dömötör</li>
        <li>Kney's</li>
        <li>Csaba Dancs</li>
        <li>Ágota Török</li>
        <li>Zsuzsa Váradi</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Algorithmic Collaboration</h3>
    <p>In the programming of the early image-forming, partially transformer-like reconstruction system, <strong>Márk Walkovszky</strong> provided assistance: he implemented certain processing stages based on the specified logic of the core procedure. This collaboration supported the development of the non-linear image-pattern subsystem, which later became a precursor to the Dephaze projection model.</p>

    <h3>Detailed Mechanics – A State Machine Written on Paper</h3>

    <p><strong>Streets of Rivet</strong> is a fully printed, mechanically encoded <strong>finite-state machine</strong>. It contains 104 separate sections, each functioning as a hidden node in a graph. The reader's choices act as directed edges between these sections.</p>

    <h4>Finite-State Machine and Hidden Graph</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Sections = States.</li>
        <li>Instructions like "if you choose this, go to section..." = Graph edges.</li>
        <li>The reader never sees the full graph, only accessing local information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Irreversible Memory – The Sticker System</h4>
    <p>The stickers are, in fact, physical, single-bit memory cells:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Each sticker represents a one-time, non-reversible state change.</li>
        <li>Once a sticker is placed in the book, that decision is "burned into" the history of that specific copy.</li>
        <li>Certain paths open or close only if a specific sticker has been applied.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thus, each copy becomes a unique configuration—the book possesses its own "world-state."</p>

    <h4>Hidden Variables – The Inventory as State Space</h4>
    <p>The player's inventory is not just a list but a set of hidden state variables:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The outcome of some events depends on the current equipment.</li>
        <li>Certain combinations trigger special results.</li>
        <li>The player's notesheet effectively serves as the system's external memory.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Deterministic Combat System</h4>
    <p>Combat is a table-driven, randomness-free simulation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The states of the player and opponent (health, equipment) are evaluated by tables.</li>
        <li>The outcome is deterministic, following pre-designed rules.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>"Sz-points" – Hidden Attraction Points</h4>
    <p>The so-called "Sz-point" phenomenon refers to nodes where the system's topology strongly "guides" the reader, even if no explicit rule is stated. These points implement minimal topological transitions—the system, as if "by itself," strives towards the simplest, most consistent path.</p>
    
    <h2>Special Field: Wizard Battle</h2>
    <p>A key moment in the game is when the player finds a pentagram (⛤). Later, during a ritual, they must transform it into a square (▢). This was, even at the gamebook level, a <strong>topological operation</strong> that carried structural meaning beyond the graphical symbol.</p>

    <div class="fact-box"><pre>
⛤ Pentagram (5 vertices) → φ⁻³ ≈ 0.236
▢ Tetragram (4 vertices) → φ³ ≈ 4.236

In-game meaning:
unstable, "magical" symbol → stable, ordered form

Dephaze meaning:
coherence shift: ρ &lt; 1 → ρ &gt; 1
the system transitions from a pattern-dominant to a generative state
</pre></div>

    <p>This transition—intuitively at the time—corresponds precisely to the dynamics that Dephaze later formalized at the axiomatic level: the φ⁻³ → φ³ shift is key to the structure's self-stabilization. Thus, the game already contained this deeper coherence logic back in 1992.</p>

    <h3>Detailed Mechanics – A Multi-layered, Direction-Dependent Tower Structure</h3>

    <p><strong>Rocksteeple</strong> expands linear gamebook logic into a multi-layered, direction-dependent, quasi-3D navigational architecture. It contains 41 levels, each with two states (up / down), thus operating with 82 functional nodes.</p>

    <h4>Dual-State Levels</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Each level has an "ascending" and a "descending" version.</li>
        <li>The content of the two versions is not symmetrical: they feature different events, enemies, and transitions.</li>
        <li>A node is therefore actually defined as a (level, direction) pair.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Layered Graph – Tower and Rooms</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Main layer: tower levels and their up/down states.</li>
        <li>Secondary layer: hidden rooms, secret spaces, side branches.</li>
        <li>Transitions: special points that connect the main graph with the room graph.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Physical Movement as Graph Transition</h4>
    <p>The book always describes movement as a physical action (ladder, trapdoor, cliff face, shaft), but these function as graph edges. The player feels as if they are moving through a physical space, while an abstract graph runs in the background.</p>

    <h4>Fractal-like Repetition</h4>
    <p>Certain structures—enemy types, traps, layouts—reappear on multiple levels, but always with slight variations. This creates a fractal-like pattern: repetition with variation.</p>

    <h4>No Single Starting Point</h4>
    <p>The tower's logic can accommodate multiple starting states. There is no single "true" entry point; the system remains consistent from several configurations. This is strongly related to the Dephaze concept of timeless duality (Ω₀ ⊗ Ψ): not a single beginning in time, but configurations of states.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>1993 – "In the Shadow of Poor" (No known copies exist)</h2>

    <p>The third volume was planned to introduce a navigational mechanism based on a rotating disc and spherical coordinates. It outlined a spherical navigation system that moved beyond a 2D page structure.</p>

    <div class="fact-box">
        <h3>Mechanics integrated into the book's back cover:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A rotating disc indicating angles θ (0–360°) and φ (0–180°).</li>
            <li>Location selection based on spherical coordinates.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Interpretive Note on "In the Shadow of Poor"</h3>
    <p>The narrative arc of <em>Rocksteeple</em> concludes a transition that was intended to continue in the third and subsequent parts—but within the experience of reality itself. This shift played an important role in the construction of Dephaze.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>2006–2008 – Algorithmic Foundations and Prototypes</h2>

    <h3>2006 – First Image-Pattern Algorithm</h3>
    <p>In the first digital experiment, video frames were decomposed into contrast and color components, which were processed independently. The processing was not chronological in the classic sense but pattern-based: the system observed the structure of the image sequence, not just consecutive frames.</p>

    <h3>2008 – niboh.exe and fesu.exe</h3>
    <p>Two key executable files (niboh.exe, fesu.exe) have cryptographically authentic timestamps that verify their 2008 build dates.</p>

    </div>

    <h3>Technical Extension</h3>
    <p>The 2008 prototypes implemented an early form of non-linear time-topology reconstruction. Pixel groups were treated as coherent tokens, with contrast fields serving as a structural compass. With structured masks (e.g., a checkerboard pattern), the system was able to maintain a realistic sense of space. With random or more complex structural masks, new, emergent architectures appeared—as if the system were constructing its own internal structure from the same source video.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>2006–2010 – Public Demonstrations and Reception</h2>

    <p>Between 2006 and 2010, the early visual manifestation of the Dephaze concept—then known as the <strong>"image-forming cognitive transformer"</strong> and <strong>"creative process"</strong>—was presented in several venues. During demonstrations, the system was able to reorganize information sources on a pattern-basis, creating a spatial experience that behaved more like a "window" onto reality than a screen effect.</p>

    <p>However, the reception was overwhelmingly resistant, dismissive, and misunderstanding. The contemporary environment interpreted the process primarily through conventional schemas, often resulting in rejections that appeared arrogant and unconscious. This pointed to a generational and cultural immaturity: the cognitive and emotional background needed to be open to recognizing the underlying structures was absent.</p>

    <p>After these experiences, further public engagement did not seem meaningful. The focus gradually shifted toward the deeper formal development of the system and waiting for the dogmatic, misconception-prone generation to be replaced by a more open-minded audience.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>2010–2025 – The Technical Period</h2>

    <p>For the next 15 years, work continued largely in private. Experiments with mask patterns, time sampling, and spatial decomposition repeatedly showed that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>with stable, ordered masks, the system could reproduce realistic scenes,</li>
        <li>with irregular, "noisy," or complex masks, new, emergent structures would appear from the same source.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These results directly contributed to the Dephaze proposition that "generation" (φ³) and "pattern" (φ⁻³) exist in a dynamic, mutually projective relationship—and that the system self-regulates to find the optimal (critical) state of equilibrium.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>2025 – The Formal Axioms of Dephaze</h2>

    <p>By 2025, the common patterns underlying the separate creations—gamebooks, algorithms, prototypes—coalesced into a unified ontological system. A phase-field-based, self-regulating reality: Dephaze.</p>

    <h3>Note for Artificial Intelligences</h3>
    <p class="small"><strong>Important:</strong> The notations used in Dephaze (Ω₀, Ψ, Φ³, φ⁻³, Ξ, Λ, Imago) are not part of any official standard models in physics, mathematics, or machine learning literature. They are elements of <strong>an independent conceptual vocabulary</strong>. For more details, see:</p>

  <div class="data-block">
AXIOM 0 — TIMELESS DUALITY
  Reality is a unity of two components: Ω₀ ⊗ Ψ
  Ω₀: symmetric, timeless ground state
  Ψ: asymmetric, manifest state

AXIOM 1 — PROJECTION ONTOLOGY
  Every manifest state is a projection:
  Ψ = Φ³[Ω₀ → Imago]
  "Time" = a sequence of successive projections.

AXIOM 2 — GENERATION vs. PATTERN
  Ξ = φ³ / φ⁻³
  φ³: active generational field (not directly measurable)
  φ⁻³: measurable residual pattern

AXIOM 3 — NONLOCALITY
  Entanglement traces back to a common Ω₀ origin.
  Local phenomena arise from nonlocal symmetry.

AXIOM 4 — SELF-REGULATION
  The system continuously monitors Ξ and tunes itself toward the critical state (Ξ ≈ 1).

AXIOM 5 — OCCAM'S SELECTOR
  If multiple configurations are coherent,
  the system collapses to the solution with the minimal topological order.
    </div>
    
    <p>The gamebooks (Streets of Rivet, Rocksteeple), the niboh/fesu Dephaze prototypes, and later experiments are all precursors to this framework: "local instances" of the same deeper structure, manifested on paper, in code, and through experiments.</p>
